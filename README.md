# HFT-OS: A Custom Bare-Metal Operating System for High-Frequency Trading

**Proof of Concept | Experimental Infrastructure Project**

---

## Overview

This project explores the design and implementation of an ultra-low-latency, kernel-less custom operating system built from scratch specifically for high-frequency trading (HFT). The goal is to create a system that sits in the performance gray zone between fully hardcoded FPGA solutions and customized Linux-based software stacks.

This minimal bare-metal runtime:
- Has no kernel, no syscalls, no context switches
- Offers deterministic CPU access without schedulers
- Interfaces directly with a network interface card (NIC)
- Is flexible and reprogrammable, unlike fixed-function FPGA logic

---

## Motivation

Modern HFT infrastructure typically leans toward two extremes:

| Approach        | Pros                                    | Cons                          
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------
| FPGA            | Hard real-time, sub-microsecond latency | Inflexible, costly, difficult to modify                          |
| Customized Linux| Flexible, large ecosystem.              | Suffers from syscall overhead, jitter, and general-purpose bloat |

This project explores a third approach — a custom operating system that:
- Runs directly on bare metal
- Interfaces with the NIC using memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) and polling
- Executes application logic deterministically
- Minimizes stack complexity while retaining programmability

- **NIC (Network Interface Card)**:
  - Uses memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) to expose RX/TX descriptor rings directly to the OS.
  - Timestamps packets using hardware-based PTP or internal NIC clock.
  - Bypasses kernel — driver communicates directly via PCIe.

- **Custom OS**:
  - No kernel, no scheduler, no system calls.
  - Market Data Ingest: Processes packets directly off the RX ring.
  - Strategy Engine: Hard-coded or config-driven trading logic pinned to a specific CPU core.
  - Order Execution: Prepares and injects packets into the TX ring (NIC DMA handles transmission).

- **Ultra-Low Latency Switch**:
  - Layer 2/3 network appliance that forwards packets with sub-microsecond jitter.
  - Ensures deterministic and minimal-hop routing to exchange.

- **Exchange**:
  - Acts as both market data publisher and order receiver.


Each instance of the OS runs on a pinned CPU core. The logic flow includes:
- Receiving raw market data from the NIC via polling
- Executing a fixed-purpose trading strategy
- Transmitting orders via the NIC with minimal delay

There are no system calls, no kernel-user transitions, and no scheduling overhead — just tight control of every clock cycle.

## System Design

- Architecture: x86_64 (UEFI or BIOS boot)
- Timing: Hardware timestamping via NIC or HPET
- I/O Model: MMIO-based polling loops (RX/TX queues)
- Network: Ethernet (10G/25G), raw packet-level access
- Execution: Single address space, monolithic binary runtime
- Logging: Optional ring-buffer logging or serial out

## Core Components

### Bootloader
- Written in x86 assembly (NASM)
- Initializes CPU to long mode, sets up paging
- Loads runtime binary into memory and jumps to entry point

### Runtime Engine
- Freestanding C/C++ code (no libc)
- NIC driver initialization and polling
- Strategy execution loop (user-defined logic)
- Direct TX ring writes for order dispatch

### NIC Driver
- Targets Intel 82599, Mellanox, or other PCIe-based NICs
- Initializes descriptor rings
- Performs zero-copy packet handling
- Uses polling for minimal latency

### Time Synchronization (Optional)
- PTP or NIC-level timestamps for precise nanosecond accuracy
- Used to align local system time with exchange clocks
